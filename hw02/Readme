The 4 buttons operate the same way as hw01 where they correspond to the keyboard commands.
They are supposed to simply run the script and it should run. It is programmed in javascript.

Due to my SD card not being acepted by my board and not fully understanding why it isn't working, 
I was unable to get the script to run on the board. When i run it run on my board. My board
only accepts the 3.8 version of java script. So I am not sure if the error that appears when I run
this script is because of a coding error or simply an incompatability between software and my hardware.
I was unable to get in contact with another member in the class to test it.
