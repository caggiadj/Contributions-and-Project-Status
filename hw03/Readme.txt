It will shoot out temperatures when you heat up the sensors to about 80 degrees and will work only within that field since the low and high are set to 20 and 25 degrees celsius.

Usage instructions are missing.

Looks like your script polls the sensor rather than uses interupts.
js code looks good, but could use some documenaton.
