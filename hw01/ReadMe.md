 I have done all of the 7 steps. For step 2, the labels are on a reference piece of paper that I keep in the box.

Comments from Prof. Yoder:
I have labels you can use.

I get warnings when compiling

led_sketchpad.c:30:18: note: previous implicit declaration of ‘setRight’ was here
   else if(dir==1)setRight();

I get a segmentation fault when running.

./a.out 
Enter the maximum size of the square sketchpad: 10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
